# Mesh_Pro_DesktopApp

Description: Multi-threaded Java/JavaFX application that runs Blender 3D modelling software in the background and processes 3D meshes ready for VR applicaitons (decimates surface, adds material, converts file format etc). This app was made to process medical CT segmentations (from .stl format to gtlf format) to load into Microsoft's HoloLens device using <a href=https://github.com/CaroloS/HoloCT >HoloCT </a> app. <br> <br>
Made in collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital, NHS ‘Digital Research, Informatics and Virtual Environments’ unit (DRIVE): https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/news/great-ormond-street-hospital-partner-microsoft-transform-healthcare-using-artificial-intelligence and UCL industry exchange (IXN) network: http://ixn.org.uk/.

And for glTF export support, the glTF exporter from the Khronos group needs to be installed to Blender as an add-on as here:
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter <br>
